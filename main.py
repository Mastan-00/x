# To begin:

# Take an input from the user for the total balance to be payed.
# Take an input from the user for minimum payment amount.
# Take an input from the user for how many payment periods they have until the deadline.
# Calculations:

# Calculate the monthly payment needed to fully pay off a balance with the allotted time frame.
# Prompt the user to input the monthly payment amounts.
# If the payment amount is too small, change to the minimum payment amount.
# If the payment is larger than the remaining balance, change to the remaining balance.



# userPayment = checkOverPayment(checkMinimumPayment(checkPositiveFloat(checkFloat(input(f"Please make your {x}st payment:\n")))))
